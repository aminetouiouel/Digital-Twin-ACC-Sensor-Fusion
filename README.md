# Digital-Twin-ACC-Sensor-Fusion
This repository contains the implementation of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system based on multi-sensor fusion for autonomous vehicles. The system integrates data from multiple sensors including LiDAR, monocular camera, and depth camera to achieve robust environmental perception and safe vehicle control in simulated environments.
